1. List the features that your team have successfully implemented.

	Our team has successfully implemented multiple statements that include:
	print, while, assign, if, and for loops. We have also implemented int,
	bool, float, list, and dictionary types, along with several different 
	operations that include the following:

	UnaryOp: Not, UAdd, and USub
	BoolOp: And and Or
	BinOp: Add, Sub, Mult, Div, Mod, Pow, and FloorDiv
	Compare: Eq, NotEq, Lt, LtE, Gt, GtE, Is, IsNot, In, NotIn
	Additional collection operations: list and dict subscripts for both storage and retrieval.

2. State each author’s contributions.

	Thomas wrote a grammar for the features that we support.
	All three of us did pair programming while we wrote the Python code.
	Hailey and Thomas wrote the first C code and test file.
	We pair programmed during the last of the C code, an the debugging.

	
3. If your team have discussed with another team, list that team’s members.

	Our team did not discuss with any other teams. 
	
4. Any suggestions?

	A more clear definition of what features we need. Comments in the sample code would be helpful as well.
